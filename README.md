This project implements a simple Multilayer Perceptron(MLP) inside a Jupyter Notebook. The main goal was to test different Optimization functions. 
SGD, Adam and RMSprop is tested with different number of neurons, layers and training epochs. <br>

The MNIST dataset is used. It is downloaded as an import in the project. <br>
It is also availabe for download here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv  <br>

I have taken inspiration from these guides: <br>

In this link you can download pytorch to make it possible to use GPU instead of CPU for training if your GPU supports it: <br>
